# Product Table Implementation - Complete ✅

## Project Overview
Successfully implemented a complete product management system with CRUD operations, pagination, sorting, and form validation using the DummyJSON API. The application is built with Next.js 15, TanStack Query, and follows modern React best practices.

## Completed Features

### ✅ 1. Data Table Integration
- Integrated DummyJSON Products API with TanStack Query
- Used existing DataTable component to display product data
- Displays products with title, price, rating, brand, category, and stock

### ✅ 2. Pagination
- Implemented pagination using API's `limit` and `skip` parameters
- Added Previous/Next buttons with page indicators
- Set limit to 10 products per page

### ✅ 3. Sorting
- Enabled client-side sorting on title, price, and rating columns
- Uses TanStack Table's built-in sorting functionality
- Both ascending and descending order supported

### ✅ 4. CRUD Functionality

#### Add Product
- Form with Zod validation using react-hook-form
- Validates title, description, price, brand, and category
- Updates TanStack Query cache optimistically
- Shows success/error toasts

#### Update Product
- Edit existing products using the same form
- Pre-fills form with current product data
- Updates cache on successful mutation

#### Delete Product
- Delete confirmation dialog
- Removes product from cache on success
- Shows appropriate feedback

### ✅ 5. Product Detail Page
- Navigate to `/products/[id]` by clicking product title
- Fetches individual product data
- Displays product image, details, price, rating, etc.
- Back navigation button

### ✅ 6. Dynamic Page Titles
- Products page: "All Products – MyShop"
- Product detail: "{Product Name} – MyShop"
- Resets to default title when leaving pages

### ✅ 7. Form Validation with Zod
- Created productSchema with proper validation rules
- Integrated with react-hook-form using zodResolver
- Shows field-specific error messages
